        <h1>Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF) Algorithm</h1>
        <p>
            This algorithm is based on the idea that that he R/W
            head should proceed to the track that is closest to its
            current position. The process would continue until all
            the track requests are taken care of.
            <br><br>
            In SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First), requests having the
            shortest seek time are executed first. So, the seek time 
            of every request is calculated in advance in the queue and 
            then they are scheduled according to their calculated seek 
            time. As a result, the request near the disk arm will get 
            executed first. SSTF is certainly an improvement over FCFS 
            as it decreases the average response time and increases the 
            throughput of the system.

        <h3>How SSTF Works</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The algorithm starts with the current head position.</li>
            <li>It scans all pending requests and finds the one that requires the shortest seek time (i.e., the smallest distance from the current position).</li>
            <li>The disk head moves to that request and serves it.</li>
            <li>After servicing, the algorithm repeats the process by finding the next nearest request.</li>
            <li>This continues until all requests are completed.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Advantages of SSTF Algorithm</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Since the shortest distance is always selected, it reduces the overall seek time.</li>
                <li>Provides quicker access to frequently requested data.</li>
                <li>Generally performs better than FCFS for large workloads.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h3>Disadvantages of SSTF Algorithm</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Requests located far from the current head position may experience starvation if closer requests keep arriving.</li>
                <li>Some requests may wait indefinitely, especially in heavily loaded systems.</li>
                <li>Due to possible starvation, it's not suitable for real-time applications.</li>
                <li>Continuous recalculation of the shortest seek time increases algorithm complexity.</li>
            </ul>
