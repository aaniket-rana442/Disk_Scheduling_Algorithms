        <h1> SCAN Scheduling Algorithm</h1>
        <p>
            In the SCAN algorithm, the disk arm starts at one end of the disk and moves
            toward the other end, servicing requests as it reaches each cylinder, until
            it gets to the other end of the disk. At the other end, the direction of head
            movement is reversed, and servicing continues. The head continuously scans back
            and forth across the disk. The SCAN algorithm is sometimes called the elevator
            algorithm, since the disk arm behaves just like an elevator in a building, first
            servicing all the requests going up and then reversing to service requests the other way.
            <br><br>
            This algorithm is performed by moving the R/W head
            back-and-forth to the innermost and outermost track. As
            it scans the tracks from end to end, it process all the
            requests found in the direction it is headed. This will
            ensure that all track requests, whether in the outermost,
            middle or innermost location, will be traversed by the
            access arm thereby finding all the requests. This is
            also known as the Elevator algorithm.

        <h3>How SCAN Algorithm Works</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The disk head moves in one direction (either towards the higher-numbered or lower-numbered tracks).</li>
            <li>It serves all the requests in that direction until it reaches the end of the disk or the last request.</li>
            <li>After reaching the end, the disk head reverses its direction and serves requests on the way back.</li>
            <li>This back-and-forth movement is similar to an elevator that moves up and down, stopping to serve people (requests) on the way.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Advantages of SCAN Algorithm</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensures that all requests are eventually served.</li>
                <li>Ideal when there are many requests spread across the disk.</li>
                <li>Provides a good compromise between seek time and fairness.</li>
                <li>Easier to predict seek times compared to random algorithms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Disadvantages of SCAN Algorithm</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Requests located near the ends of the disk may experience longer wait times.</li>
                <li>The head travels to the edge even if no requests are present, increasing seek time.</li>
                <li>Other algorithms like LOOK and C-LOOK can reduce unnecessary movements.</li>
            </ul>
