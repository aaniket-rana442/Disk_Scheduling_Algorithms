        <h1>Circular LOOK (C-LOOK) Algorithm</h1>
        <p>
            Circular LOOK is like a C-SCAN which uses a return
            sweep before processing a set of disk requests [2]. It
            does not reach the end of the tracks unless there is a
            request, either read or write on such disk location
            similar with the LOOK algorithm.
            <br><br>
            As LOOK is similar to the SCAN algorithm, in a similar way,
            C-LOOK is similar to the C-SCAN disk scheduling algorithm. In C-LOOK,
            the disk arm in spite of going to the end goes only to the last request to be serviced in 
            front of the head and then from there goes to the other end's last request. 
            Thus, it also prevents the extra delay which occurred due to unnecessary traversal to the end of the disk.
        </p>
        <h3>Working of C-LOOK Algorithm</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The disk head moves in one direction (typically from low to high) to serve all pending requests.</li>
            <li>It stops at the last request in that direction, without going to the end of the disk.</li>
            <li>Instead of reversing, the disk head jumps back to the lowest request and continues servicing requests in the same direction.</li>
            <li>This movement forms a circular path, hence the name C-LOOK.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Advantages of C-LOOK Algorithm</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The circular nature reduces unnecessary movements compared to SCAN or LOOK.</li>
                <li>It does not go to the end of the disk unless necessary.</li>
                <li>This algorithm works well with large disk sizes and heavy loads.</li>
                <li>It provides a more predictable and faster response time for requests.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Disadvantages of C-LOOK Algorithm</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Requests closer to the starting point may have to wait longer.</li>
                <li>Slightly more complex to implement compared to FCFS or LOOK.</li>
                <li>Starvation may occur if continuous requests arrive in one direction.</li>
            </ul>
